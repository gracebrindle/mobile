            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <div class="bio">
                <p>
                    I am a graduate student at the University of Michigan pursuing a Master of Science in Information with a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction.
                    I graduated from Carleton College in  2021 with a major in History and a minor in Digital Arts &amp; Humanities. I
                    am passionate about creating people-first technology that is accessible, inclusive, and empathetic.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2>Digital Humanities</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                    As a History major, one of the primary things I have learned is that stories have power:
                    how a story is told, what parts are emphasized, and for whom it is intended shape the communities around us.
                    I believe that technology is a potent storytelling device: data visualizations frame narratives,
                    websites host our stories, and creative programs like Photoshop bring our artistic visions to life. As a digital humanist,
                    I aspire to tell stories through technology that amplify marginalized voices,
                    connect communities, and bridge gaps between people, technology, and information.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2>Public Engagement and Community Service</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                   I convinced my mother to run for mayor of my hometown when I was 18 years old because I believed it was the right thing to do. This
                    philosophy of public service and commitment to the public good has stayed with me throughout my life has carried over to
                    my professional career. I believe technology is a powerful tool for social good and community organizing. 
                    To that end, I have worked with a number of non-profits, including historical societies, arts collectives,
                    and community-based organizations, to integrate technology into their work and advance their missions.  
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2>User Experience Research and Design</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
    Every product tells a story. I aim to craft a narrative that is centered around the user and their experience, one that is relatable and enjoyed by all kinds of people.
    Through this digital storytelling, I hope to invite joy, curiosity, and social connection—-to restore humanity to technology.
