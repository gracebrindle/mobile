                <a href="https://serenazabin.com/game/">Witness to the Revolution</a>
                is an educational computer game built in
                <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>
                designed to teach the public about the events of the Boston Massacre. The game is a collaboration
                between Professor Austin Mason and Professor Serena Zabin at Carleton College, and
                will be installed at the Old State House in Boston upon completion as an introduction
                to the museum. Players of the game must piece together testimonies of the Boston Massacre
                in preparation for the soldiers’ trial as they decide whether to support the prosection or the defense.

                <br />
                In Fall 2019, I enrolled in a course called
                <a href="https://apps.carleton.edu/campus/registrar/catalog/current/course-details/?subject=HIST&number=210">The Boston Massacre in 3D: Mapping, Modeling and Serious Gaming</a>
                where students helped build the digital infrastructure for the game. I worked on creating the user interface
                of the player’s map that he or she would use to navigate the streets of Boston. This involved designing the
                appearance of the map, including the typography, icons, and display, as well as implementing the design in Unity.
                I began by researching map styles from other video games and creating a mockup of the map, identifying potential
                icons and fonts. I then translated this vision to Unity where I added functionalities, including the abilities
                to resize the map and toggle between map layers and icons. You can read my reflection on this work

                This project embodies how digital technology has expanded the realm of opportunity for education,
                allowing for a much more interactive and hands-on learning experience. By playing Witness to the Revolution,
                museum visitors gain a firsthand perspective of what life would have been like in eighteenth century Boston
                during this time.
